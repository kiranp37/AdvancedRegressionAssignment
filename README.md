## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
- For this, the company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Different models were built for predicting the prices of houses based on various features using:
- 1. Linear Regression
- 2. Ridge Regression
- 3. Lasso Regression

- LR model had evident over fitting issues, which were addressed by building models with regularisation methods like Ridge and Lasso.

- Ridge and Lasso models were built with different alpha (hyperparameter) values and the optimum value is identified. This was used to build the final model of each reqularisation method
- Optimum alpha for Ridge: 500
- Optimum alpha for Lasso: 0.01

- Model metrices like R2 values for train and test, mean square error are compared for the various models
